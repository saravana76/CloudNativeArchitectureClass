= Lab 6 - Binding to Cloud Foundry Services

[abstract]
--
The _Spring Music_ application was designed to illustrate the ease with which various types of data services can be bound to and utilized by Spring applications running on Cloud Foundry.
In this lab, we'll be binding the application to both PostgreSQL and MongoDB databases.

Cloud Foundry services are managed through two primary types of operations:

Create/Delete:: These operations create or delete instances of a service.
For a database this could mean creating/deleting a schema in an existing multitenant cluster or creating/deleting a dedicated database cluster.
Bind/Unbind:: These operations create or delete unique credential sets for an existing service instance that can then be injected into the environment of an application instance.

== A Bit of Review

Your instance of _Spring Music_ should still be running from the end of link:../lab_05/lab_05.html[Lab 5].
Visit the application in your browser by hitting the route that was generated by the CLI:

image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_NS.png[]

The information dialog in the top right-hand corner indicates that we're currently running with an in-memory database, and that we're not bound to any services.
Let's change that.

== The Services Marketplace

There are two ways to discover what services are available on Pivotal Web Services.
The first is available on any instance of Cloud Foundry: the CLI. Just type:

----
$ cf marketplace
----

and you'll get a list of services, their available plans, and descriptions. On Pivotal Web Services, the ``free'' tier of plans is normally the first one listed (e.g. `turtle` for `elephansql`).

The second way is specific to PWS's Application Manager UI.
If you haven't already, login to it by visiting http://console.run.pivotal.io.

Click on the ``Marketplace'' link:

and you'll see the same service/plan/description listing in the browser:

== Creating and Binding to a Service Instance

. Let's begin by creating a PostgreSQL instance provided by http://www.elephantsql.com/[ElephantSQL].
From the CLI, let's _create_ a free ElephantSQL service instance:
+
----
$ cf create-service elephantsql turtle spring-music-db
Creating service spring-music-db in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Next we'll _bind_ the newly created instance to our `spring-music` application:
+
----
$ cf bs spring-music spring-music-db
Binding service spring-music-db to app spring-music in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. Notice the admonition to `Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect`.
Let's take a look at the environment variables for our application to see what's been done. We can do this by typing:
+
----
$ cf env spring-music
----
+
The subset of the output we're interested in is located near the very top, titled `System-Provided`:
+
====
----
System-Provided:
{
 "VCAP_SERVICES": { <1>
  "elephantsql": [
   {
    "credentials": {
     "max_conns": "5",
     "uri": "postgres://xnxzdeao:ntLT0M10gz014oXnKkkjeIqLn3Td2EgH@babar.elephantsql.com:5432/xnxzdeao" <2>
    },
    "label": "elephantsql",
    "name": "spring-music-db",
    "plan": "turtle",
    "tags": [
     "Data Stores",
     "Cloud Databases",
     "Developer Tools",
     "Data Store",
     "postgresql",
     "relational",
     "New Product"
    ]
   }
  ]
 }
}
----
<1> `VCAP_SERVICES` is a special Cloud Foundry environment variable that contains a JSON document containing all of the information for any services bound to an application.
<2> Notice here the unique URI for this instance of PostgreSQL that `spring-music` has been bound to.
====

. Now let's _restage_ the application, which cycles our application back through the staging/buildpack process before redeploying the application.footnote:[In this case, we could accomplish the same goal by only _restarting_ the application via `cf restart spring-music`.
A _restage_ is generally recommended because Cloud Foundry buildpacks also have access to injected environment variables and can install or configure things differently based on their values.]
+
----
$ cf restage spring-music
----
+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Spring Music_ application loaded:
+
image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_PGSQL.png[]
+
As you can see from the information dialog, the application is now utilizing a PostgreSQL database via the `spring-music-db` service.

. *(OPTIONAL STEPS)* If you have a PostgreSQL GUI tool handy (you can download a free one at http://www.pgadmin.org/download), you can also take a look at the _Spring Music_ data directly in the database.

. In pgAdmin, create a new server connection and populate the properties with values from the URI in your `VCAP_SERVICES` environment variable (remember `cf env spring-muisc`!):
+
image::../../../Common/images/pgadmin_props.png[]

. Connect to the server and scroll (if necessary) until you find your specific database instance:
+
image::../../../Common/images/pgadmin_db_instance.png[]

. Right-click on the `album` table and choose ``View Data > View All Rows'' to see the data inserted as part of _Spring Music_'s startup process:
+
image::../../../Common/images/pgadmin_table.png[]

== Swapping from PostgreSQL to MongoDB

. Now let's bind our _Spring Music_ application to MongoDB instead of PostgreSQL. First let's create footnote:[Notice in this listing that we're typing `cf cs` rather than `cf create-service`.
Most CF CLI commands have a shorthand version to save typing time.
You can view these shorthand commands via `cf help` or `cf h` (See! More shorthand!).] a MongoDB instance from https://mongolab.com/[MongoLab]:
+
----
$ cf cs mongolab sandbox spring-music-mongo
Creating service spring-music-mongo in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Next we'll unbind our application from our PostgreSQL instance (_Spring Music_ does not support being bound to multiple datasources at the same time):
+
----
$ cf us spring-music spring-music-db
----
+
If you visit your application now, you'll see that it still works.
If you recall, environment variable changes (such as binding/unbinding of services) don't actually take effect until a _restage_ or _restart_.

. Now let's bind the application to our MongoDB instance:
+
----
$ cf bs spring-music spring-music-mongo
Binding service spring-music-mongo to app spring-music in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
TIP: Use 'cf restage' to ensure your env variable changes take effect
----

. And then do a restage:
+
----
$ cf restage spring-music
----

+
Once the application is running again, revisit or refresh the browser tab where you have the _Spring Music_ application loaded:
+
image::../../../Common/images/Spring_Music_Mongo.png[]
+
As you can see from the information dialog, the application is now utilizing a MongoDB database via the `spring-music-mongo` service.

. Let's take a direct look at the data in MongoDB by utilizing the `Manage` link in PWS App Manager:
+
image::../../../Common/images/PWS_Manage_Spring_Music_Mongo.png[]
+
This uses Cloud Foundry service SSO to pass your authentication through to MongoLab's management UI (you may be asked to authenticate again because your session may have expired with PWS's login server).

. Once in MongoLab's UI, click on your deployment:
+
image::../../../Common/images/MongoLab_Deployment.png[]

. Next, click on your `albums` collection:
+
image::../../../Common/images/MongoLab_Collection.png[]

. Now you should be able to see the documents in your collection:
+
image::../../../Common/images/MongoLab_Document.png[]

== Clean Up

Because of the limited PWS quota we have for this course, let's clean up our application and services to make room for future labs.

. Delete the `spring-music` application:
+
----
$ cf d spring-music

Really delete the app spring-music?> y
Deleting app spring-music in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Delete the `spring-music-mongo` service:
+
----
$ cf ds spring-music-mongo

Really delete the service spring-music-mongo?> y
Deleting service spring-music-mongo in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

. Delete the `spring-music-db` service:
+
----
$ cf ds spring-music-db

Really delete the service spring-music-db?> y
Deleting service spring-music-db in org oreilly-class / space instructor as mstine@pivotal.io...
OK
----

= Lab 10 - Leveraging Spring Cloud Connectors for Service Binding

In this lab we'll bind our RESTful web service from link:../lab_09/lab_09.html[Lab 9] to a MySQL database and leverage Spring Cloud Connectors to easily connect to it.

NOTE: The completed code for this lab can be found at `$COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_03/lab_10/complete/cities`.

== Using Spring Cloud Connectors

. Change to the lab directory (the initial state for this lab is the same as the completed state for link:../lab_09/lab_09.html[Lab 9], so you can choose to continue with that project if you like footnote:[However, please use the copy of `import.sql` found in the `lab_10/initial/cities/src/main/resources` directory. It is a subset of the original dataset, which is necessary because we are using a free tier database service on PWS.]):
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_01/session_03/lab_10/initial/cities
----

. At present we're still using the in-memory database. Let's connect to a MySQL database service.
From the CLI, let's _create_ a MySQL service instance:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf cs p-mysql 100mb-dev cities-db
Creating service cities-db...
OK
----

. Next add the service to your application manifest, which will _bind_ the service to our application on the next push. We'll also add an environment variable to switch on the ``cloud'' profile,
+
[source,yml]
----
---
applications:
- name: cities
  memory: 512M
  instances: 1
  path: build/libs/cities-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
  timeout: 180
  services:                        # Add
  - cities-db                      # these
  env:                             # four
    SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE: cloud  # lines
----
+
You can also accomplish the service binding by explicitly binding the service at the command-line:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf bind-service cities cities-db
Binding service cities-db to app cities...
OK
----

. Next we'll add Spring Cloud and MySQL dependencies to our Gradle build. Comment or remove the +hsqldb+ line add add the following in the +dependencies+ section:
+
[source,groovy]
----
dependencies {
    // ....
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-spring-service-connector:1.1.0.RELEASE")
    compile("org.springframework.cloud:spring-cloud-cloudfoundry-connector:1.1.0.RELEASE")
    runtime("'org.mariadb.jdbc:mariadb-java-client:1.1.7'
")
}
----
+
Since we've added new dependencies, re-run +./gradlew idea+ or +./gradlew eclipse+ to have them added to the IDE classpath.

. Next, let's create the package +org.example.cities.config+ and create in that package the class +CloudDataSourceConfig+. Add the following code:
+
[source,java]
----
@Profile("cloud")
@Configuration
public class CloudDataSourceConfig extends AbstractCloudConfig {
    @Bean
    public DataSource dataSource() {
        return connectionFactory().dataSource();
    }
}
----
+
As before, have the IDE import the appropriate dependencies.
+
The +@Profile+ annotation will cause this class (which becomes Spring configuration when annotated as +@Configuration+) to be added to the configuration set because of the +SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE+ environment variable we added earlier. You can still run the application locally (with the default profile) using the embedded database.
+
With this code, Spring Cloud will detect a bound service that is compatible with +DataSource+, read the credentials, and then create a +DataSource+ as appropriate (it will throw an exception otherwise).

. Add the following to +src/main/resources/application.properties+ to cause Hibernate to create the database schema and import data at startup. This is done automatically for embedded databases, not for custom ++DataSource++s. Other Hibernate native properties can be set in a similar fashion:
+
[source,java]
----
spring.jpa.hibernate.ddl-auto=create
----

. Build the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

. Re-push the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

. Take a look at the +env+ endpoint again to see the service bound in +VCAP_SERVICES+:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ curl http://cities-colorado-contemplator.nyc.fe.gopivotal.com/env
...
"VCAP_SERVICES":"{\"p-mysql\":[{\"name\":\"cities-db\",\"label\":\"p-mysql\",\"tags\":[\"mysql\",\"relational\"],\"plan\":\"100mb-dev\",\"credentials\":{\"hostname\":\"10.68.106.85\",\"port\":3306,\"name\":\"cf_7a5601f9_32e3_41e1_b523_ed5ca96418f5\",\"username\":\"Vm2Z9D848eagt4rq\",\"password\":\"JgstkF06p2SOTlZg\",\"uri\":\"mysql://Vm2Z9D848eagt4rq:JgstkF06p2SOTlZg@10.68.106.85:3306/cf_7a5601f9_32e3_41e1_b523_ed5ca96418f5?reconnect=true\",\"jdbcUrl\":\"jdbc:mysql://10.68.106.85:3306/cf_7a5601f9_32e3_41e1_b523_ed5ca96418f5?user=Vm2Z9D848eagt4rq&password=JgstkF06p2SOTlZg\"}}]}",
...
----
The application is now running against a MySQL database.

== Customizing the +DataSource+

. You can customize the database connection that Spring Cloud creates with a few lines of code. Change the +dataSource+ method in +CloudDataSourceConfig+ to add some pooling and connection configuration:
+
[source,java]
----
@Bean
public DataSource dataSource() {
    PooledServiceConnectorConfig.PoolConfig poolConfig =
            new PooledServiceConnectorConfig.PoolConfig(5, 200);

    DataSourceConfig.ConnectionConfig connectionConfig =
            new DataSourceConfig.ConnectionConfig("characterEncoding=UTF-8");
    DataSourceConfig serviceConfig = new DataSourceConfig(poolConfig, connectionConfig);

    return connectionFactory().dataSource("cities-db", serviceConfig);
}
----

. Build the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ ./gradlew assemble
----

. Re-push the application:
+
[source,bash]
----
$ cf push
----

# Define: Microservice
> Loosely coupled service oriented architecture with bounded contexts...
-- Adrian Cockcroft

---

# Loosely Coupled

If every service has to be updated in concert, it’s not loosely coupled!

---

# Bounded Contexts

If you have to know about surrounding services you don’t have a bounded context.

# Patterns

- Cloud-native application architectures
- Optimized for speed, safety, & scale
- Declarative configuration
- Stateless/shared-nothing processes
- Loose coupling to application environment

---

# Twelve Factors (1/2)

- One Codebase in Version Control
- Explicit Dependencies
- Externalized Config
- Attached Backing Services
- Separate Build, Release, and Run Stages
- Stateless, Shared-Nothing Processes

---

# Twelve Factors (2/2)

- Export Services via Port binding
- Scale Out Horizontally for Concurrency
- Instances Should Be Disposable
- Dev/Prod Parity
- Logs Are Event Streams
- Admin Processes

---

# Spring Boot
- [http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot)
- Opinionated convention over configuration
- Production-ready Spring applications
- Embed Tomcat, Jetty or Undertow
- *STARTERS*
- Actuator: Metrics, health checks, introspection

= Lab 18 - Declarative REST Clients with Feign

[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
We'll again use Spring Cloud Netflix to implement client-side load balancing with Ribbon.
However, this time we'll use a declarative REST repository based on Netflix Feign.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Refactor the consumer application from link:../../session_06/lab_17/lab_17.html[Lab 17] to use a `ProducerClient` enabled by Feign
. Test the new consumer version against our local pool of producers
--

== Setup

. A completed `springbox-config-server` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-config-server` for your convenience.
In a terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-config-server
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/springbox-config-server-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springbox-eureka` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-eureka` for your convenience.
In a separate terminal window, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-eureka
$ mvn package
$ java -jar target/springbox-eureka-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. A completed `springbox-producer` project has been placed in `$COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-producer` for your convenience.
In two separate terminal windows, change to that directory, rebuild, and run the application (on different ports):
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-producer
$ mvn package
$ SERVER_PORT=8080 java -jar target/springbox-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
$ SERVER_PORT=8082 java -jar target/springbox-producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Ensure you have two instances of the producer service registered in Eureka:

== Using Feign

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_18/initial/springbox-consumer
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
+
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-feign</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. Add a `@EnableFeignClients` annotation to the class `io.springbox.consumer.SpringboxConsumerApplication`.

. Create the interface `io.springbox.consumer.ProducerClient` and into it paste the following code:
+
----
@FeignClient("producer")
public interface ProducerClient {

    @RequestMapping(method = RequestMethod.GET, value = "/")
    ProducerResponse getValue();
}
----

. Refactor the class `io.springbox.consumer.ConsumerController` to autowire the `ProducerClient` instead of `RestTemplate`, and then use it to obtain the `ProducerResponse`:
+
----
@Autowired
ProducerClient client;

@RequestMapping(value = "/", produces = "application/json")
String consume() {
    ProducerResponse response = client.getValue();
    return String.format("{\"value\":%d}", response.getValue());
}
----

. Build the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/springbox-consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application and show that it is still receiving values from the producers.
Also, watch the producers and observe that Ribbon is performing round robin load balancing across the two producers:
+
----
$ curl -i localhost:8081
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 11
Content-Type: application/json;charset=UTF-8
Date: Tue, 24 Feb 2015 05:47:33 GMTServer: Apache-Coyote/1.1X-Application-Context: consumer:8081

{
  "value": 5
}

= Lab 20 - Monitoring Circuit Breakers with Hystrix Dashboard

[abstract]
--
Let's continue learning the components found in Spring Cloud to implement patterns for distributed systems.
Now we'll monitor what's happening in our Circuit Breakers by using Netflix Hystrix Dashboard.

In this lab, we'll do the following:

. Run everything that we created in  link:../../session_06/lab_19/lab_19.html[Lab 19].
. Create a Hystrix Dashboard
. Kill both of the producers and watch the circuit open in the Dashboard.
. Restart a producer and watch the circuit close in the Dashboard.
--

== Setup

. Make sure you've completed link:../../session_06/lab_19/lab_19.html[Lab 19] and have everything still running.

== Building the Hystrix Dashboard

. Change to the lab directory:
+
----
$ cd $COURSE_HOME/day_02/session_06/lab_20/initial/springbox-hystrix-dashboard
----
+
and import the project (via `pom.xml`) into your IDE of choice.

. Add the following dependency to `pom.xml`:
+
----
<dependency>
	<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
	<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-hystrix-dashboard</artifactId>
</dependency>
----

. Add a `@EnableHystrixDashboard` to the class `io.pivotal.springcloud.hystrixdashboard.HystrixDashboardApplication`.

. Create the file `src/main/resources/application.yml` and into it paste the following:
+
----
server:
  port: 7979
----

. Build the application:
+
----
$ mvn package
----

. Run the application:
+
----
$ java -jar target/hystrix-dashboard-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar
----

. Now, access the Hystrix Dashboard at http://localhost:7979.
Enter http://localhost:8081/hystrix.stream into the text field  and click the ``Monitor Stream.''

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application several times and show that the circuit breaker is registering successful requests.

== Fallback

. Shut down both of the producer processes.

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application and show that it is only emitting the fallback value of `42`.

. You should also see the circuit breaker is registering short-circuited requests.

== Recovery

. Restart one of the producer processes. Wait for it to register with Eureka.

. Using `curl`, test the consumer application and show that eventually recovers and starts hitting the new producer process. This can take several seconds as the Eureka and Ribbon caches repopulate.

. Continue to watch the dashboard. You should also see the circuit breaker dashboard show the recovery.
